Please note that **this repository is deprecated as of the latest versions of devkitARM and 
devkitPPC.** The Pacman-based package system is far superior.

The repository is kept around, but will only be maintained for platforms not covered by devkitPro 
and/or for testing work intended to cooperate with devkitPro's official repository.

To use, add utils/ to $PATH. pkg-build [package] should do the rest for you.
